This is a minimal quick-start file until a proper manual can be created.

TO RUN THE SERVER

1. Open up runserver.ss in DrScheme.
2. Run it.

Note: if you're running this for anything but the test of everything that's described below, note your IP; you and others will need it when you run the client/daemon. Consult operating system documentation to learn how to do this, or ask someone!

TO RUN THE CLIENT/DAEMON

1. Open up runclient.ss in DrScheme.
2. Run it; answer the questions it asks.
3. Open up project.ss in another window and take off!

TO TEST OUT EVERYTHING

Follow the server instructions above.
Follow the client/daemon instructions above (for server address, when it asks, say 'localhost').
In the project.ss window type (help). Try all these commands and make sure they work.
